With computing problems, I need to solve just 75 problems. There's no real time constraint but, I can actually do it in some months. There is no real hassle to do it. 

Let's index it:
[75 Problems](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75)

Before even leaning into the problems. Let's revise on Time complexities and, Data Structures. 

## Resources:
1. [Intro to DSA - Piyush Garg](https://codedamn.com/learn/data-structures-algorithms)
2. [Grokking Algorithm Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22847284-grokking-algorithms-an-illustrated-guide-for-programmers-and-other-curio)

Things to Learn: 
1. Time Complexity
2. Number System Revision - Too dumb to do that now
3. Bit wise Operators and, how the bits magic happens in computers
4. Basic Data Structures
