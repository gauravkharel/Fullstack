Information Architecture (IA) is essentially the blueprint of your product's information and navigation structure. It defines how content is organized, labeled, and accessed, making it easier for users (and developers) to understand and interact with the system. Let’s break it down with your points in mind:

### Key Aspects of Information Architecture

1. **Content Organization and Navigation**
    
    - **Structure, Not Just Navigation:**  
        IA is more than just menus, breadcrumbs, or button flows. While those are visible components, IA defines the entire organizational structure of content—like a sitemap for your application.
    - **Early Blueprint:**  
        Typically, IA is developed in the early stages, often before or alongside user flows. It provides the "big picture" map that informs how you design user journeys and wireframes.
2. **Relationship with User Flows**
    
    - **Foundation for User Flows:**  
        Think of IA as the underlying schema that informs your user flows. While user flows detail the step-by-step processes users take to achieve specific tasks, IA sets up the overall structure that those flows navigate.
    - **Iterative Process:**  
        Often, you’ll refine both IA and user flows as you discover more about user needs and application requirements. They complement each other rather than one strictly coming before the other.
3. **Visual Hierarchy and Taxonomy**
    
    - **Organizing Content Visually:**  
        IA involves creating a visual hierarchy that reflects the importance and relationships among content. This helps ensure that key features and information are immediately accessible.
    - **Legends and Conventions:**  
        While it might not always be a “legend” per se, IA involves establishing naming conventions, labels, and icons. This creates consistency across the application, making it easier to understand and navigate—much like how a codebase benefits from clear documentation and consistent naming.
4. **Developer Perspective**
    
    - **Blueprint for Implementation:**  
        For developers, a well-defined IA is like a schema or directory structure—it outlines how data is organized and how different parts of the application relate. This clarity can help streamline both frontend layout and backend data organization.
    - **Facilitating Wireframes and Prototypes:**  
        With IA in place, you have a clear roadmap that informs the creation of wireframes. It tells you where each element should go and how users are expected to interact with the application, reducing potential ambiguities during development.

### Fact-Checking Your Points

- **Navigation Outline:**  
    Yes, IA does include the mapping of navigational elements like menus and breadcrumbs. However, it’s broader than just these components.
- **Early Design Stage:**  
    You’re correct that IA is usually established before moving into low-fidelity designs. It sets the stage for user flows and wireframes.
- **User Perspective and Flow:**  
    IA is designed to understand and support how users interact with the application. It helps uncover challenges and opportunities from a user’s viewpoint.
- **Visual Hierarchy & Legends:**  
    Organizing information through visual hierarchy is a key part of IA. While a “legend” isn’t a universal term, establishing consistent icons, labels, and interactions is definitely part of the process.

### In Summary

Information Architecture provides the foundational map for your product’s content and navigation. It’s like designing the directory structure or schema for a project—clear, organized, and essential for both developers and designers. By setting up IA early, you ensure that subsequent steps, such as creating user flows and wireframes, are built on a solid understanding of how the application is structured and how users will navigate through it.

This clarity not only simplifies the development process but also enhances the overall user experience by ensuring intuitive and consistent navigation.
