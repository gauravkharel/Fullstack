#### Use Cases

- **User Registration**
    - User provides credentials, system creates a new user account
- **User Login**
    - User provides credentials, system verifies and issues a JWT
- **Send Message**
    - User composes a message, system encrypts and sends it to recipient
- **Receive Message**
    - System receives an encrypted message, decrypts and displays it to the user
- **View Chat History**
    - User accesses previous messages with a specific contact

#### Additional Considerations

- Security measures (encryption, authentication, authorization)
- Scalability and performance optimization
- Error handling and logging
- Deployment and maintenance plan

### Additional Notes

- Use clear and concise language
- Add diagrams or flowcharts where necessary
- Regularly update the document as the project progresses
- Consider using a version control system for the document
